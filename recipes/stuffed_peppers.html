            <h3>Hungarian Pepper Roux (thickener)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>3 tablespoons oil</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons flour</li>
                <li>1 jar tomato puree (28 oz)</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
                <li>2 bay leaves</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
                <li>Vegeta seasoning to taste</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 F </li>
        </ol>
            <h3> Hungarian Pepper Stuffing</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a medium saucepan, add 2 tablespoons of oil and fry the onions for about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and fry for another minute. When the onions are caramelized and starting to brown, remove from heat and place in a large bowl.</li>
                <li>In a small saucepan, parboil the rice. Add 2 cups of water to the rice and bring to a boil, allowing to boil for about 5 minutes. Drain, rinse with cold water and add the the large bowl with onions.</li>
                <li>To the large bowl, add the ground meat, 1 egg, 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 generous teaspoon of paprika, and 1 teaspoon of black pepper. Using your hands, mix the ingredients together until evenly mixed.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Making Hungarian Stuffed Peppers</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Cut the ends off the peppers and remove the seeds. Using your hands, gently stuff the peppers with the meat mixture. With any leftover meat, roll them into meat balls. Place the peppers and extra meatballs in a deep baking tray. It needs to be deep enough to allow the sauce to completely cover the peppers as they cook.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Hungarian Pepper Roux (thickener)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Using the same medium saucepan as you used for frying the onions, heat 3 tablespoons of oil. When oil is hot, add 3 tablespoons of flour to make a roux. Fry together over medium-low heat for 2 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon tomato paste to the roux and fry for another minute.</li>
                <li>Slowly add the tomato puree to the roux mixture, while mixing the entire time to smooth out any lumps. Rinse out the tomato puree jar, filling it about halfway with water, shake and pour into the saucepan.</li>
                <li>Add 2 bay leaves, salt and pepper to taste. Add Vegeta seasoning to the sauce for a richer flavor. Taste the sauce. If it is too tart, add 1 tablespoon of sugar.</li>
                <li>Pour the hot tomato sauce over the stuffed paprika peppers, and cover with foil.</li>
                <li>Place the stuffed paprika peppers into the oven for about 1- 1 1/2 hours. The cooking time depends on the size and thickness of the pepper, meat and rice. Check at the 60 minute mark and decide if it needs more time.</li>
                <li>Serve the pepper in a bowl or plate with plenty of sauce. Enjoy with generous dollop of sour cream and freshly chopped parsley.</li>
            </ol>
